Now we start our introduction to our write up
For your write up, write a brief introduction to what you are doing in the in lab. two to four sentences. 
Omit this section for the prelab.

\textbf{10.4 Pre-Lab Requirements:} 

Image of the spice schematic and a plot of the input and all subsequent out-
puts (outputs of each individual stage) for a transient simulation for Jingle19
submitted to Canvas. Include the plot of the output and a circuit schematic,
nothing else. The schematic and plot should be appropriately labeled. Images
that are unclear or vague will receive little to no points. Your plot must include
the following in different plot planes: input voltage, output of the high pass
filter, output of the variable gain amplifier, output of the buffer stage (at least
one), and the current of both LEDs. The gain doesnâ€™t need to be high enough
to induce clipping in order to show that both LEDs turn on but the first LED
should turn on.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stage 1: Active High Pass Filter

    \item Stage 2: Active High Pass Filter

    \item Stage 4: Buffer Stage

This is where I start to answer the questions in the lab. We only need to do this for the write up.
